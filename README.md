# Word-Sense-Disambiguation-WSD-
- Implemented a model that maximizes the accuracy of WSD using Neural Networks. The input layer of the neural network consisted of nodes having binary values depending on the presence or absence of frequently occurring context words related to ambiguous words. The output layer consisted of nodes equal to the number of senses the ambiguous word has. We trained and tested our models using lexical resources such as SemCor or OMSTI. Technologies used were: Anaconda Navigator, Python, Qt Designer platform.
